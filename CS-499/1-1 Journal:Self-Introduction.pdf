I am Ilyass Hmamou, currently a computer science undergraduate in my final term, about to graduate. 
For the past six years, I've had a professional career in the software industry, starting as a software engineer and later transitioning into the role of a software solution architect. 
I have been in the computer science program for approximately eight years. I started with an associate's degree from a two-year college, leading to my first job as a software engineer. 
After a few years, I realized my ambition to attain a bachelor's degree and thus transferred my credits to SNHU. 
For the past four years, I've been steadily taking one or two classes each term.
While a significant portion of my knowledge and skills was acquired through hands-on professional experience, enrolling in the academic program has notably enhanced my problem-solving abilities. 
It has also introduced me to a variety of interesting tools outside my usual work domain and deepened my understanding of fundamental tasks, such as class design and database architecture, which I previously executed instinctively.
Looking forward, my career goals primarily revolve around securing positions in engineering management. Although my current role as a software solution architect is an important step in that direction, I believe that furthering my education in computer science with an advanced degree will be invaluable.
